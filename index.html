        <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages interactive (e.g., having complex animations, clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.). There are also more advanced server side versions of JavaScript such as Node.js, which allow you to add more functionality to a website than downloading files (such as realtime collaboration between multiple computers). Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li>
                <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</li>

        <div><h3 id="what">What you Already Know</h3></div>
        <div>
            <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).</li>
                <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
                <li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.</li>
        </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3 id="JavaScript">JavaScript And Java</h3>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            Java is a class-based programming language designed for fast execution and type safety. Type safety means, for instance, that you can't cast a Java integer into an object reference or access private memory by corrupting the Java bytecode. Java's class-based model means that programs consist exclusively of classes and their methods. Java's class inheritance and strong typing generally require tightly coupled object hierarchies. These requirements make Java programming more complex than JavaScript programming.
        </div>
        <div><h3 id="hello">Hello World</h3></div>
        <div>
            <p>A "Hello, World!" is a simple program that prints Hello, World! on the screen. Since it's a very simple program, this program is often used to introduce a new programming language to beginners.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>
                // the hello world program
                console.log('Hello World');

            </p>
        </div>
        <div><h3 id="variable">Variables Scope</h3></div>
        <div>
            <p>
                You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
            </p>
            <p>
                A variable may belong to one of the following scopes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Global scope: The default scope for all code running in script mode.

                    </li>
                    <li>Module scope: The scope for code running in module mode.
                    </li>
                    <li>Function scope: The scope created with a function.
                    </li>
                </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3 id="global">Global Variables</h3>
            <p>Global variables are in fact properties of the global object.</p>
            <p>In web pages, the global object is window, so you can read and set global variables using the window.variable syntax. In all environments, the globalThis variable (which itself is a global variable) may be used to read and set global variables. This is to provide a consistent interface among various JavaScript runtimes.</p>
            <p>Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or frame from another window or frame by specifying the window or frame name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is declared in a document, you can refer to this variable from an iframe as parent.phoneNumber.</p>


        </div>
        <div>
            <h3 id="constant">Constants</h3>
            <p>You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as any variable identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore, or dollar sign ($), and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.</p>
            <p>const PI = 3.14;</p>
            <p>A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is running. It must be initialized to a value. The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block-scope variables.</p>
            <p>However, const only prevents re-assignments, but doesn't prevent mutations. The properties of objects assigned to constants are not protected, so the following statement is executed without problems.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3 id="data">Data Type</h3>
            <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines eight data types:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Seven data types that are primitives:</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
                    <li>null. A special keyword denoting a null value. (Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.)</li>
                    <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is not defined.</li>
                    <li>Number. An integer or floating point number. For example: 42 or 3.14159.</li>
                    <li>BigInt. An integer with arbitrary precision. For example: 9007199254740992n.   </li>
                    <li>String. A sequence of characters that represent a text value. For example: "Howdy".
                    </li>
                    <li>Symbol. A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </ul>

        </div>
        <div>
            <h3 id="else">if else statement</h3>
            <p>The if/else statement executes a block of code if a specified condition is true. If the condition is false, another block of code can be executed. The if/else statement is a part of JavaScript's "Conditional" Statements, which are used to perform different actions based on different conditions.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3 id="while">While Statement</h3>
            <p>The while statement creates a loop that executes a specified statement as long as the test condition evaluates to true. The condition is evaluated before executing the statement.11 Feb 2025

        </div>
        <div>
            <h3 id="function">Function statement</h3>
            <p>In JavaScript, functions are objects, and they have both properties and methods. A function can also be defined using an expression (See Function Definitions).
